## 1. Introduction

This project was developed in 2016 with the objective to create an virtual training environment for blind people practice the Braille. 

> Braille is a tactile writing system used by people who are visually impaired. It is traditionally written with embossed paper.

## 2. About

This project was supported by Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia do Rio Grande do Norte ([IFRN](https://ifrn.edu.br)) and coordinated by [Prof. Dr. Rodrigo Leone Alves](http://lattes.cnpq.br/1000805043084706).

## 3. Usage

The user can initiate the system and manipulate it with no buttons (only gestures) and switch the environment modes (number mode and letters mode). The main screen is a grid with 6 touchable square fields that user can click and set a bullet position, forming the draw of a braille character. After a while, reader will tell him which word/number he typed or if the draw doesn't match with any character, the voice will tell him that draw was incorrect.

You can try out this app cloning this repo and running in your machine after all android dev requirements installed.
